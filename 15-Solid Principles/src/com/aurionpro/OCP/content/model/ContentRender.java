//In a learning management system,
//the ContentRenderer class uses if-else or switch blocks to render different content types 
//(video, article, quiz).
//Adding a new type (e.g., podcast) requires modifying this class. 
//Task: Refactor the system so it’s open for extension but closed for modification.
